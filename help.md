# PlayMusic's Help System

PlayMusic's Help System is a small and quick look at its front facing commands. You may use any of these commands to your hearts desire.

## Music Commands;

1. "/help" => Displays this help system.
2. "/play [song_title]" OR "/play [artist] > [song_title]" OR "/play [YOUTUBE VIDEO LINK]" => Will locate the song in the song database and add it to the playlist. It will begin playing immediately if no song is queued. Otherwise it will queue itself. It will reply with "No Matching Song/Artist Found." if the song isn't in the database. If you select a youtube video to play, the system will download the audio, and once the download is completed it will queue the song and begin playing asap.
3. "/playlist" => will return the currently playing queue. As well as a numerical listing of the songs currently in queue.
4. "/whatplaying" => will return the song title and artist title for the song that is currently playing in voice channel.
5. "/next" => skips the song.
6. "/library" OR "/library pg [#]" => shows the first 10 entries in the database, which is sorted in alphabetical order. Or goes a specific page in library.
7. "/pause" => Pauses the currently playing song.
8. "/resume" => resumes the previously paused song.
9. "/stop" => stops currently playing song and prevents the song from moving to the rest of the playlist.
10. "/volume [int]" => Sets the volume of the current track, where int is a value between 0 and 100 inclusive.
